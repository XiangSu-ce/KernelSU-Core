# Reporting Security Issues

The KernelSU Core team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/XiangSu-ce/KernelSU-Core/security/advisories/new) tab, or join our QQ Group (325900535) to contact us.

This project is based on [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) by [@tiann](https://github.com/tiann). For security issues in the upstream KernelSU project, please report to the [original repository](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/security/advisories/new).

The KernelSU Core team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
